# PieBoard Client

To create a PieBoard:
1. Install Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS Lite onto an SD card, and boot up the raspberry pi
2. run the `setup.sh` script. This will configure this device to be a PieBoard. The script will ask for a new password at first, but after that step no other input is needed.

*Note: This process modifies configuration files that makes the Pi Read-Only, PieBoard is only meant to run on dedicated devices!*
